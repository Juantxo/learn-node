Node.js is a popular open-source runtime environment that can execute JavaScript outside of the browser. The Node runtime is commonly used for back-end web development, leveraging its asynchronous capabilities to create networking applications and web servers. Node also is a popular choice for building command line tools.

Node.js uses g the V8 JavaScript engine, which is the same engine used to power the Google Chrome web browser's JavaScript execution.

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you will need:

- Node.js installed on your development machine. This tutorial uses Node.js version 10.16.0. To install this on macOS or Ubuntu 18.04, follow the steps in How to Install Node.js and Create a Local Development Environment on macOS or the “Installing Using a PPA” section of How To Install Node.js on Ubuntu 18.04.
- A basic knowledge of JavaScript, which you can find here: How To Code in JavaScript.

## Installation

_Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up your app. This template doesn't rely on any external dependencies or services._

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Juantxo/learn-node.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Program

To run this program, use the node command as follows:

```sh
  $ node hello.js
```

The Node.js interpreter read the file and executed console.log("Hello World"); by calling the log method of the global console object. The string "Hello World" was passed as an argument to the log function.

Although quotation marks are necessary in the code to indicate that the text is a string, they are not printed to the screen.

Having confirmed that the program works, let’s make it more interactive.
